    any WYSIWYG or text editor. 
-   Replace the default text and the default links.
-   Featured Slider should contain images of ratio 24:10.
-   Featured Images should also contain images of ratio 24:10. 
-   No lightbox has been set for images for any page other than the
    “**Gallery**” page, to enable lightbox for images on other pages,
    simply follow the instructions at http://fancybox.net/howto.

    you have removed the \<aside\> section entirely and add the class
    “fullwidth” to the element article, that is, \<article\> should
    become \<article class=”fullwidth”\>.
